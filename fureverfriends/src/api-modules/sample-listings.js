Dream is a wonderful guinea pig, looking for a home to call his own. Dream is still getting used to being picked up and handled, but with lots of patience and socialization, he will be a wonderful piggy! Dream will need a large enclosure and plenty of time outside of the cage, which will be great for bonding and growing closer with him! Dream loves to eat Timothy hay (and should be provided an unlimited amount), pellets, and fresh greens every day. He will also need his Vitamin C supplemented, as guinea pigs do not produce their own - bell peppers are a good source! We recommend doing plenty of research before making him part of your family!

        "description":"#717640Age: Mature AdultWeight: Unknown How this pet arrived:This pet was brought in by their Previous Owner on March 19th, 2021. At SDHS:This pet has been receiving excellent care! Why this pet is the one for you: Meet Rhino! He is looking for a rat-savvy human who will spend lots of time with him. Rats are social creatures, so Rhino will need to go with his best buddies Granger (717638) and Dino (717639) Rats need to have a nice spacious enclosure (4 or 5 cubic feet) filled with toys, hammocks, and hiding holes. Get creative! There is a wonderful DIY community for rat enrichment. At meal times, you can provide them with their rat pellets, safe fruits, and veggies! Monitor their intake of sweet/fatty foods so they can stay fit, healthy and happy. They'd love to get out of the enclosure to get a good stretch! Just be sure to put up all the cords and other chewable items, as well as blocking off any potential hiding spots that you can't reach. You can set them up with different toys and mazes and watch them break a mental sweat! Rats are extremely intelligent and love to work out puzzles in exchange for tasty snacks. Doesn't that sound like the perfect way to spend the day? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started! Primary Color: White",

        "description":"#717639Age: Mature AdultWeight: Unknown How this pet arrived:This pet was brought in by their Previous Owner on March 19th,2021. At SDHS:This pet has been receiving excellent care! Why this pet is the one for you: Meet Dino! He is looking for a rat-savvy human who will spend lots of time with him. Rats are social creatures, so Dino will need to go home with his best buddies Grander (717638) and Rhino (717640)! Rats need to have a nice spacious enclosure (4 or 5 cubic feet) filled with toys, hammocks, and hiding holes. Get creative! There is a wonderful DIY community for rat enrichment. At meal times, you can provide them with their rat pellets, safe fruits, and veggies! Monitor their intake of sweet/fatty foods so they can stay fit, healthy and happy. They'd love to get out of the enclosure to get a good stretch! Just be sure to put up all the cords and other chewable items, as well as blocking off any potential hiding spots that you can't reach. You can set them up with different toys and mazes and watch them break a mental sweat! Rats are extremely intelligent and love to work out puzzles in exchange for tasty snacks. Doesn't that sound like the perfect way to spend the day? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started! Primary Color: White",

        "description":"Hawk is a super sweet friendly guinea pig who's fine around other pets who are not prey driven.  So cute with black and white colors he's just a doll.  Hawk's owner somehow let Hawk get into someone or something that made him lose his left eye.   They brought him to the vet and didn't want him anymore so they told the vet to euthanize him.  Which was cruel, a guinea pig can do just fine with one eye.  So the nice vet decided to remove his damaged eye and foster him until we can find Hawk a good loving home.  He will be three in April.  He's very affectionate and loving and will be a wonderful baby for someone who is experienced with guinea pigs. He's neutered so he could be housed with a accepting female.   Or he can be around a dog or cat who is used to being around a two pound critter.,,We are looking for a non smoking, loving home who already has a guinea pig set up.  He comes with his hay and his vetting is all done already but has little else to come with.   If you are interested and a guinea pig lover...â€¦..call or text me at 517 294 4514 or email me at marlas2468@yahoo.com",

        "description":"Sylvanas is a tri-colour roan mix female born to one of our rescues on February 4, 2021.  She's still a baby, so will need taming, but she's very bright and will learn easily.  She is learning \"cookie time\", but needs work to take a syringe for vitamin C.  She has been checked by a vet and is healthy.,,She's used to living in a herd, and could match up with one of our pairs, other singles, or your own female guinea pig who needs a friend.  A bonding session would be performed with your existing piggie to ensure compatibility.,,**We highly recommend that baby guinea pigs have vitamin C supplement daily until 4- 5 months old.,**The minimum space required for a pair of guinea pigs is 8 square feet of FLAT floor space, with at least 2 foot in width. Second stories would be considered additional space and not counted as part of the required minimum. We can advise on cage size for 3 or more.,**Bunny hutches are not acceptable housing for guinea pigs.,**Adoption fees are $35, single; $50, pair; $70, trio.,,,Video and more pictures coming soon!",

        "description":"Sonic was born to one of our rescues on February 4, 2021, along with 3 siblings.  He's a white crested roan mix.  He's playful and talkative.,,Knuckles was originally paired with another piggie, but they broke up when he hit puberty, so we let him choose a new pal.  Sonic was a natural match!  Knuckles was born around October 13, 2020, and has been with us since December, 2020.,,These bright boys play and cuddle together.  They are active, sweet, gentle, and still shy.  As Sonic gets older and the both bond with their new family, they'll become more tame.  They're learning \"cookie time\" and will take a syringe for vitamin C if picked up.,,With a little gentle taming work, these playful piggie boys will be good companions for children who know how to handle small pets (under supervision, please).,,**Male guinea pigs should only be kept in pairs.,**We highly recommend that baby guinea pigs have vitamin C supplement daily until 4- 5 months old.,**The minimum space required for a pair of guinea pigs is 8 square feet of FLAT floor space, with at least 2 foot in width. Second stories would be considered additional space and not counted as part of the required minimum.,**Bunny hutches are not acceptable housing for guinea pigs.,,Video and more photos coming soon!",

        "description":"Hanzo is a 5 month old tri-colour guinea pig.  His buddy Genji is a tri-colour roan mix piggie born to one of our rescues on January 31, 2021.,,Hanzo was originally paired with a different friend, but they broke up when his pal went through puberty.  After trying a few boys together, Hanzo and Genji chose each other.  They are playful, sweet boys.  Hanzo does zoomies and popcorns and gets Genji to follow him.  They often cuddle together, too.,,Both boys are learning \"cookie time\" and will take a syringe for vitamin C if you pick them up.  Being young, Genji still needs taming.  Hanzo is particularly bright and easy to work with.  They are cuddly and gentle.,,Hanzo & Genji are playful piggies who would be good companions for children who know how to handle small pets (under supervision, please).,,**Male guinea pigs should only be kept in pairs.,**We highly recommend that baby guinea pigs have vitamin C supplement daily until 4- 5 months old.,**The minimum space required for a pair of guinea pigs is 8 square feet of FLAT floor space, with at least 2 foot in width. Second stories would be considered additional space and not counted as part of the required minimum.,**Bunny hutches are not acceptable housing for guinea pigs.,,,Video and more pictures coming soon!,",

I was originally brought to a shelter with several siblings and we didn't have enough space, so I was kind of rude to them and had to fight over food. But I could potentially live with another male pig, if we had plenty of space and the right living conditions (a very slow introduction would have to happen). I am friendly to people and am easy to handle!,,If you are interested in adding a nice pig to your family call the shelter at 603-472-3647 x201 to find out more and to schedule an appointment to meet (and hopefully adopt) me!",

        "description":"Chai is a sweet 7 month old short haired Syrian hamster. She is tentative at first but always curious and wanting to be played with daily. She also loves taking treats from you and running in her wheel!,,Chai needs further handholding work as she gets a bit excited when picked up. Therefore, we would suggest someone who has experience with hamsters. Chai's adoption fee is $15 and her current enclosure (pictured) is also available for an additional donation.,,If you are interested in adopting Chai you can fill out an application here,http://furangelsas.com/application/.",

        "description":"Atilla is a shy guy but warms up if you take things slowly.  He weighs just over 3 pounds.  He has been neutered and is working on litter box training.,Rabbits are great pets, but they have very specific care needs that must be taken care of for them to live happy and healthy lives! Make sure you are committed to meeting these requirements if you are thinking of adopting from us!,,- They must have a large, clean cage with solid floors and either shredded paper bedding or fleece covering them (wood bedding can cause respiratory illness). They can also be house trained with some patience! Rabbits are very active and smart, so they require lots of space to explore and run around in! In addition to a large area, you will have to give them lots of rabbit-safe toys to play with to keep them occupied and content. Contact us to get a list of appropriate enrichment ideas and cage recommendations!,,- They must have a good quality pellet, with no dried fruit, nuts, seeds, colored bits or processed sugary treats. Ingredients like these pose a choking hazard and can also cause illness due to an imbalanced diet. We like to feed our rabbits Oxbow brand rabbit food because it is free from all of the above! Spending a bit more money for good food will save in vet bills later!,,- They require vet care. While they don't need vaccinations, they can become ill or have injuries. They need care just like a dog or cat! We can point you in the direction of an exotics vet if you don't have one already!,,- They are fragile animals, therefore children must be supervised while handling them. - We do not adopt out small animals to homes with unfixed animals of the opposite gender. If you feel you are an exception to this, please talk with staff about your situation!",

She may just be a gal who is slower to adjust to big life changes.  Once held she calms down and enjoys being pet.  With lots of socialization and love she should have no problem bonding to her new owner and may even enjoy a rabbit friend.  Rabbits need plenty of time outside of their cage to run and play. Ruby has a long life ahead of her. She is only 2 years old.

        "description":"*gray dwarf hamster,*Born about summer 2020 approximately,-Benny came to us after being taken from a home with some other animals by a humane officer.  Unfortunately he hasnâ€™t been treated very well and the man who owned him used to bang on the sides of the cage :(. And then told the officer that he was â€œaggressive.â€  He has not been aggressive here, he is skittish and prefers not to be held but does not go after you at all when youâ€™re around him.  I think he has the potential, with some kind, slow handling, to be a good boy.  If not, a lot of dwarf hammies  are happy with a nice place to nap, a big secure cage to explore, a wheel to run on, and some good food, and not much more.  Interested adopters can fill out our adoption application here: https://www.judgespark.org/adoption-application.html Adoption fee is $15 for a single hamster.",

        "description":"Available for adoption:,Courtesy Posting: Please go tot he WWW.TinyTailsK-9Rescue.com webpage and fill out a Bird adoption application and submit to the address at the top of the form.  We will forward to Kelly's owner.,Kelly,Amazon Yellow Napped Parrot,29 Yrs. Old,Located in Helena, Montana.,Kelly is an Amazon Yellow Napped Parrot. She is about 29 years young and she is looking for a new person to call her own. She prefers to bond with a single person. She will ride around your shoulder all day and enjoys car rides. Kelly will not do well with children. She has been around cats and dogs but they do tend to stress her out. She knows a variety of fun sounds and likes to say her name. She does not swear or say anything naughty but she will screech for attention or if she is worried. She will nip you if she is worried about something and you donâ€™t appear to be getting away from the danger. For example, if the cat jumps up to look at her and she is on your shoulder she will get nervous and has been known to bite.,Kelly is looking for someone who will be patient with her and win her over. Gain her trust and treat her like the princess she is. She will only be adopted to someone with exotic bird experience. We will be checking references and doing a home visit. She will come with her cage and all of her accessories. Her only health concern was several years ago she laid multiple eggs in a row and was quite ill from the stress of that on her body. She did recover and has not laid any eggs since.,Only complete applications will be considered. Kellyâ€™s home will be selected according to the best fit for Kelly. Please reach out for more information and her adoption fee.",

He likes to spend most of his time in the hidey hut on the top level platform and then run back down all of the ramps when it's time for food. If you are looking for an adorable and sweet little gerbil pal, Cyber Grape is your guy!,,Our shelter is running by appointment only.

Jazzberry Jam also enjoys burrowing through bedding and exploring the different wooden structures in his enclosure. He is social and would really enjoy going home with another gerbil friend. Jazzberry Jam is also great with handling and will happily let you pick him up so that he can sniff you and explore the environment.

        "description":"Hello, my name is Bailey! I was surrendered because I was not getting along with the cats in my house. My previous family reports that I've been good around children in the past. I've participated in doggy playgroup here at the shelter with other small dogs and did well with them. Don't tell the other dogs but I'm a staff and volunteer favorite around here! Everybody comments on what a great and sweet dog I am. I've spent a bit of time here because I was having some medical problems that the Vet needed to figure out for me. It turns out I have urinary incontinence and I'm doing better on medicine! My future family will need to follow up on this with their Vet to continue my medication. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $95.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included.",

Once we saw him there we knew he had to come with us.,He is so gentle, well mannered, great with other dogs, people and kids. He walks fantastic on a leash.,,He loves to cuddle and before you even really get to snuggle him, he falls on the floor and rolls over for belly rubs. He is the sweetest guy and a big ole Teddy bear. From behind he has this fluffy round Teddy bear Booty.... ? yes I said it... it's the cutest thing,,,Rex is crate trained and appears to be house broken as well. He is a bit hesitant of the car but does well once in it, but that's all fixable with training and getting him used to it. He is young, handsome, fluffy and doesn't have a mean bone in his body. WE DO NOT KNOW HOW HE IS WITH CATS.,,If you would like to meet Rex, send us a message in order to receive an application. Please include your location in your inquiry.,Only via e mail can you receive the proper application directly from us. Do not fill out an application for our pets anywhere online. We will not receive those.,,We are only meeting with approved applicants by appointment.,,His adoption fee is $ 350 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, neuter and micro chip.",

        "description":"Meet Apple!,,This poor thing was abandoned near a hotel called Applegate, thatâ€™s how she got the name Apple. She was loose for 3 weeks when a young girl gained enough trust and from her and was able to rescue her.,,Apple is just under 1 year old and weighs just under 25 pounds. She will be spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm tested on 3-23-21 and will be available for adoption after vetting.,,She is very sweet but very timid and shy. I believe she has been abused in the passed. She does not have an aggressive bone in her body, it just takes her time to trust people. She does seem to feel more at ease with other calm dogs around. So we do want her to go to a home with another dog.,,Due to her shy personality, we donâ€™t feel she would do well in a home with young children. Once she feels safe and loved, you will have a FURever friend! She just needs help learning that not all humans are bad.,,Appleâ€™s adoption fee is $225 to an approved and loving home. All vet records and her collar will be given to the adopted at the time of adoption.,,Please go to our website to fill out the application if interested in adopting. Our website is www.fureverfurkids.com,,The application is to be completed prior to meeting the pet(s) you are interested in adopting. If they are still on the page, they are still more than likely still available. We do keep our website and Petfinder updated regularly.,,Thank you for looking at our rescues in need of amazing homes!",

        "description":"Little Owen is a 4.5-month-old pocket Treeing Walker Coonhound weighing 17lbs. His life before rescue was not kind as his little body was deprived of food and water, to the point of being skeletal.,,Fast forward to today! Owen has gained 10lbs and all puppy, with no concern about finding food. He loves to play with toys, adores his bed to store his toys and loves to play with his adult foster friends.,,Owen loves to go on walks with his foster family and is amazingly smart on learning a routine. Walks great on leash and loves to run. If you are one to run or hike, he is perfect, especially if you have other dogs. Owen is crate trained and working on being housebroken.,,Owen is also a huge snuggler. He prefers to be held and will snuggle his little head under your chin. He truly has one of the best well rounded demeanors one could ever hope for in a forever companion.,,To apply and view our adoption process, please visit our website at furgottendogrescue.com",

        "description":",ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS,Fenced yard,Canine sibling,,Hi there! You can call me Susie or Susie Q if youâ€™d like! Iâ€™m 5 months old, and am only about 15 pounds. My first family didnâ€™t think I was a good fit for them so they decided to let this nice rescue help find me a better match! Did I mention Iâ€™m one of the cutest little beagles ever?! Since being in my current house, Iâ€™ve decided I love playing with all my foster brothers and sisters so I need another dog friend in my new home to play with and help teach me the ropes! My favorite things are playing with all my dog siblings, snuggling real hard when itâ€™s time for naps and running around in the yard so I need one of those in my next home too! Iâ€™m definitely all puppy so I have a lot of energy and will need lots of toys to chew on and play with. My foster mom and dad keep me in a crate at night for sleeping and I sleep through the whole night with no accidents. Iâ€™m still working on potty training during the day but have been doing really well as long as you keep me on a good schedule. My foster parents do say Iâ€™m super sweet though and deserve the best forever home!,,If you would like to meet Susie send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can,,Adoption donation pays for all vetting...spay surgery, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

Her owners were older with a quiet and calm household.   She is shy so would do best in the same type of home.   She is not used to rowdy children, so kids should be over 10 yrs old with some dog experience.

His face is beyond adorable with soulful brown eyes surrounded by smokey guyliner and a sweet smile all topped with a jaunty \"one ear up/one ear down combo. His appeal isn't just superficial; he's friendly, sweet and charming. Huggable and 100% lovable, he's the cuddle bear buddy of your dreams.,,* HERE'S WHAT HIS FOSTER HAS TO SAY! *,,\"Pooh Bear settled in wonderfully on day one! He's soooo chill, playful when you want him to be, great on walks, so sweet and affectionate, and cute as could be!,He looooves a good scratch. The bath was a little tough, he's very strong, so I'd recommend someone who can handle a muscular dog or wants a workout!,But he's very comfortable with everyone and it seems other dogs too. He whines when he sees other dogs and seemingly just wants to play.,He's very house broken! He even knows to lay down when he's told.,Overall, he's just a sweet old lug of a guy who will steal your heart as soon as you meet him!",

        "description":"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Harper Lee! Born around January 2018, she is beautiful, loving, joyful Pyrenees mix.,,Harper's life started out a little rocky. She was found as a hungry puppy, wandering the streets. Soon after being found, she became seriously ill and was rushed to an emergency veterinarian who found that Harper had eaten a latex glove! The glove was removed during surgery, and Harper made a full recovery.,,Fast forward to the present, as Harper was living happy life in a memory care center during the COVID pandemic. The facility underwent construction due to damage from \"snow-mageddon,\" residents were moved amongst facilities, and the chaos became too much for our sweet Harper. She needs a steady, predictable environment.,,Harper is a sensitive soul and her feelings are easily hurt with a reprimand. She is incredibly loving and cuddly. If you are okay with her fur and the space she takes up in a bed, she would love to sleep with you. If you'd rather not have her on the furniture, she will happily sleep on a fluffy dog bed nearby.,,She makes a silly grumble growly sound when she's excited and greeting people she likes. It can sound intimidating at first, but she is just saying, \"Hi! Love me!\",,Harper has been exposed to children of all ages. She loves older children who can run and play and scratch her belly. She can be over-protective of babies.,,Harper has lived in households with multiple cats and dogs. She occasionally chases the cats, but is for the most part respectful of their space. She is respectful and usually submissive to the dogs as well. She can sometimes be possessive of food. She would be fine as an only dog or with other doggie companions.,,She loves soft plush squeaky toys - the noisier the better! She also enjoys a good game of tug of war.,,Harper has a good foundation in training. She knows all the basic commands and enjoys \"shaking hands.\" She walks well on a leash after the initial excitement wears off. She crates well and will often seek out her crate if she is feeling insecure.,,SPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

        "description":"We Adopt Only in the Greater St. Louis Area!,,Must have a securelyÂ fenced yard. No Electric Fences!  No small children.Â Must live in the Greater St. Louis area.,,Meet the sweet girls, Millie and Ellie. Little Ellie is a sweet fun little red and white girl who loves her toys! She can still be a bit shy with people, but she warms up quickly.Â  Millie, the black headed tri, is affectionate and loves attention.Â  Millie is the leader in many ways. Ellie followsÂ her lead. But, when it comes to the toys, Ellie is the boss. There isn't a squeaky toy that she doesn't like and she doesn'tÂ like to share her toys. She does, however, like a good game of tug.,,Millie is about 1 1/2 years old and Ellie is four yearsÂ old. Both girls came to us from a breeder situation. Millie is a lap sitter and can't get enough attention. Ellie loves for her person to sit on the floor with her for hugs and kisses. They both like running in the yard and often play chase together.,,The girls are spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped. The girls areÂ house trained and crate trained, although Millie doesn't like her crate and will chew her bedding. She would much rather be with her person.The girls are bonded and will be adopted together. The adoption fee is $500 for the girls. Visit our website at www.petssecondchance.org for moreÂ informationÂ about Corgis and about our rescue. Email claireelizabeth@petssecondchance.org to make an adoption inquiry.,",

I am more submissive and just go with the flow.,,I get along with other dogs (even big ones!) and cats. I have not been tested with children, but my foster mom says I will do just fine!,,I am not potty trained, but I am pretty good about sticking to my puppy pad. I do good in my playpen and only cry when I am hungry or thirsty.,,Like all puppies, this is a critical time for my socialization. I can be as good as you teach me to be!

        "description":"NOTE: This is a courtesy posting for another rescuer. Please do not contact ARRF, as we do not know this pet personally. To meet Barney, see the contact information below.,,Barney is a beautiful, neutered male Lab mix who is about 4 years old. Barney was left behind when his family moved to another home in Tijuana so, because of his sweet personality, was taken in by the rescue there. He weighs about 60 lbs. and is a calm, sweet, quiet boy.,,Barney has been wormed and is up to date with his Distemper/Parvo vaccine. He is a beautiful, healthy, loving boy who is ready to face the big world out there with someone who loves him and will share adventures with him. Barney would be great with a family of an individual as he gets along well with other dogs and people,.,An adoption application, along with a video of your yard, will be requested. There is a rehoming fee, and medical records will be provided to his adopter. To meet Barney or learn more about him, call or text his foster, Pam, at 619.964.1181 or email her at Pam.Lawless@gcccd.edu.,",

We are a volunteer based group and are unable to handle the call volume.,,WE WILL BE HOLDING ADOPTIONS ON SATURDAYS & SUNDAYS FROM 10-4 PM at our Adoption Center.  Our adoption center is located next to CAL Ranch at 232 North Jones (I-95) Suite 170.   NO APPOINTMENT NECESSARY, BUT WE DO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STORE.,,Peaches is about  2  yrs old.   Buddy and Peaches are almost 2 yr old Aust Shepherd/Cattledog mixes.   The seem to be pretty bonded, Peaches more so than Buddy.   We believe that they would do best as a pair.,,They are very friendly and outgoing.   walk great on leash and very smart.   Buddy does go over 4' fences, so they would need a secure yard to play in.   They would need to be crated when alone in the home, as they can get bored and get into the trash. More will be known about me soon.,,A Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet.,,If you are interested in Peaches, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.,,This pet is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits, including a Healthy Start Certificate with the VCA Hospitals with a $250 health credit (restrictions apply).

I am the only boy in my litter, but the girls boss me around! As long as I can run and get my cuddle time in, I am perfectly happy.,,I get along with other dogs (even big ones!) and cats. I have not been tested with children, but my foster mom says I will do just fine!,,I am not potty trained, but I am pretty good about sticking to my puppy pad. I do good in my playpen and only cry when I am hungry or thirsty.,,Like all puppies, this is a critical time for my socialization. I can be as good as you teach me to be!

        "description":"ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS,Fenced yard,Canine sibling,Local to Springfield MO adoptions until vetting is complete.,,,,Hi there! You can call me Denver. Iâ€™m 3 months old, but Iâ€™m a big boy, weighing in at around 35 pounds. My first family didnâ€™t think I was a good fit for them so they gave me to a pound until this nice rescue saved me! They said I am a basset/ Australian shepherd mix. My foster mom doesnâ€™t know about all of that but she thinks Iâ€™ve definitely got some basset and maybe even a bigger hound in me. Since being in my current house, Iâ€™ve decided I love playing with all my foster brothers and sisters so I need another dog friend in my new home to play with and help teach me the ropes! My favorite things are playing extra rough with all my dog siblings and running around in the yard so I need one of those in my next home too! Iâ€™m definitely all puppy so I have a lot of energy and will need lots of toys to chew on and play with. My foster mom and dad keep me in a crate at night for sleeping and I sleep through the whole night with no accidents. Iâ€™m still working on potty training during the day but have been doing really well as long as you keep me on a good schedule. My foster parents do say Iâ€™m super sweet though and deserve the best forever home!,,If you would like to meet Denver send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.,,Adoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter surgery, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

I love to be cuddled and love to play! I have an outgoing personality and am not afraid to explore everything around me.,,I get along with other dogs (even big ones!) and cats. I have not been tested with children, but my foster mom says I will do just fine!,,I am not potty trained, but I am pretty good about sticking to my puppy pad. I do good in my playpen and only cry when I am hungry or thirsty.,,Like all puppies, this is a critical time for my socialization. I can be as good as you teach me to be! We would prefer an adopter who will put me through puppy classes and training.",

        "description":"In early February, six newborn puppies were left in a box outside in the freezing cold. All six puppies were physically frozen and had to be thawed out by the vet. Molly is one of those miracle puppies, and now sheâ€™s ready for a furever family to call her own. Molly is believed to be a boxer/hound mix who was born around February 3. Sheâ€™s currently 6 lbs and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. She is good with other dogs, kids and cats. Molly is microchipped and vaccinated. Sheâ€™ll be ready to move into her furever home after 3/21.,,Please note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppyâ€™s breed or size potential.,,PLEASE READ BELOW:,,If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt,,**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).,,The adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.,,2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:,Puppies under 12 months - $300,Dogs over 12 months - $200,,For additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq,,*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure itâ€™s the perfect match!,,**Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels.

        "description":"In early February, six newborn puppies were left in a box outside in the freezing cold. All six puppies were physically frozen and had to be thawed out by the vet. Pepper is one of those miracle puppies, and now sheâ€™s ready for a furever family to call her own. Pepper is believed to be a boxer/hound mix who was born around February 3. Sheâ€™s currently 6 lbs and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. She is good with other dogs, kids and cats. Pepper is microchipped and vaccinated. Sheâ€™ll be ready to move into her furever home after 3/21.,,Please note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppyâ€™s breed or size potential.,,PLEASE READ BELOW:,,If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt,,**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).,,The adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.,,2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:,Puppies under 12 months - $300,Dogs over 12 months - $200,,For additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq,,*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for.

        "description":"Lola is a approximately 4 year old, 18 to 20 pound, Beagle/Terrier mix. She is nothing but PURE ADORABLE!!  Lola and her pups (pups all adopted)were rescued in a rural area in MS. Lola has pretty apricot/red color with white accents on her face and feet..  These starving babies were left at a abandoned house in MS.  We knocked on the neighbors door to see about them, they said neighbors moved off in middle of the night.  We loaded all of them!  Lola is a great girl.. Super sweet and super calm... SNUGGLE BUG-loves to snuggle with everything!! She loves a calm house, and will want to be on the couch with you watching tv or snuggled up in her dog bed with another dog. She is what we call a easy dog.. not demanding.. just so sweet and she is also good with cats.  We are looking for a retired couple that is home a lot and will spoil her. She deserves it!!! She is a \"kind\" soul and just wants love... We would LOVE if her new adopter had another dog to hang around with.  Lola was a great moma to her pups and she knew the second we were their to help rescue her and her babies, she was beyond grateful.. SHE IS PRECIOUS!!!!! We are looking for owner occupants, someone that is retired or home a good bit that does not mind a dog jumping on the couch or being around them all the time.. This is a special girl!!!! A true SOUTHERN JEWEL!!! We promised her that she would NEVER be abandoned again EVER! Lola has been completely vetted to include spayed, shots, bordetella, rabies, wormed, heartworm TREATED for heartworms with a SPLIT safe treatment and now she is ready to go to her forever home. Her adoption fee is $595.00 and this already includes the transport fee.  We are a 501c3 and her adoption fee is a tax deduction for you.  We thank you in advance for saving a life!  Every adoption allows us to rescue another innocent life that would perish in a pound. If you are interested in adopting Lola contact Shelly at :    lovedogs.rescue@gmail.com",

My foster mom says I am the most special of my litter. All I want to do is play with my 110lb foster brother. We eat and drink together and I just like following him around. I am an escape artist and if there is a way out, I will find it!,,I get along with other dogs (even big ones!) and cats. I have not been tested with children, but my foster mom says I will do just fine!,,I am not potty trained, but I am pretty good about sticking to my puppy pad. I do good in my playpen and only cry when I am hungry or thirsty.,,Like all puppies, this is a critical time for my socialization. I can be as good as you teach me to be! We would prefer an adopter who will put me through puppy classes and training.",

Sam was brought to the shelter by his person on 03/19 saying he had to leave the country quickly and did not have time to find a place for Sam. Sam is very frightened and confused right now and really hopes he does not have to stay a long time. His person said Sam was house trained but had not been around dogs, cats or kids and did not know how Sam would be with them. . Sam will sit when told, knows shake, shake other paw and probably so much more.  He is a smart boy and will learn quickly.  Sam is current on vaccines, micro-chipped, tested negative for heart worms and will be neutered upon adoption. He is waiting to meet his new family in run 46 and his ID# is 627882.,Please note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers.,,This pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

        "description":"In early February, six newborn puppies were left in a box outside in the freezing cold. All six puppies were physically frozen and had to be thawed out by the vet. Grace is one of those miracle puppies, and now she's ready for a furever family to call her own. Grace is believed to be a boxer/hound mix who was born around February 3. Sheâ€™s currently 6 lbs and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. She is good with other dogs, kids and cats. Grace is microchipped and vaccinated. Sheâ€™ll be ready to move into her furever home after 3/21.,,Please note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppyâ€™s breed or size potential.,,PLEASE READ BELOW:,,If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt,,**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).,,The adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.,,2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:,Puppies under 12 months - $300,Dogs over 12 months - $200,,For additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq,,*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure itâ€™s the perfect match!,,**Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

        "description":"A connoisseur of naps and head rubs, Jerry is a cat who loves comfort.,,This cutie is a sweet, friendly, easygoing cat. And as much as Jerry likes to nap he also loves soaking up the attention. He gets right up and is ready to play (or get his head rubbed) when he senses you are near. He gets very excited for mealtime and is vocal when he's excited. Jerry is very alert which can make him a little nervous around loud noises, but also makes for fun playtimes. His favorite place to be is stretched out on a warm rug by your feet.,,Jerry is in a foster apartment with one adult therefore I am not certain how he will do children or other animals. I believe he will do well in a calm household with adults and older kids.,,Age: 6 years,How I came to PAWS: Owner surrender,Animal ID#: A49211,,I am not at the shelter.

        "description":"Raman & Theo are both between 5- 6 months old. Though they are not litter mates, they formed a bond while in foster care. They can be found wrestling or laying together. They can be quite entertaining!,,Both boys had very rough beginnings in life, but were fortunate enough to be rescued early. They are both very healthy, free from diseases. Both are neutered, fully vaccinated, microchipped, deflead, and dewormed.,,They were both a bit scared upon being rescued since they'd been living outdoors, but both boys soon found that they love the affections of humans. Theo will rub around your ankles and feet (sometimes while you're trying to walk), and Raman will stand up on his hind feet to get a pet from you. Both boys need a home where someone will be understanding that they are thriving and continue to evolve. They will be scared the first few days and hide a little, but in no time at all, you will see that they will be the first to greet you as you come through the door, as the are doing now in their foster homes. These two are so adorable and lovable!,,If you are interested in adopting this bonded pair of boys, please copy/paste this link into your internet browser and submit an application:,,http://form.jotform.us/form/50488470409157,",

        "description":"You can apply for Maple at www.ladyluckanimalrescue.org under the â€œAdopt a Petâ€ Tab.,,Maple is a very rare Siamese/Hemmingway mixed female cat born approximately on March 31, 2020. A nice woman was on vacation in North Florida and stumbled upon Maple and her two kittens in a desolate area. She couldn't just leave them there, so she brought them back and Lady Luck Animal Rescue was more than happy to help. Maple is a young mom, and she is sweet and easygoing. Her foster mom calls her the perfect lap cat. She makes the best \"biscuits\" because she has six toes! She is especially bonded with her little black kitten, Cupcake...because of this, we would love for them to be adopted together.,,Maple is spayed, microchipped, FIV/FeLV tested negative, fecal tested negative, dewormed, and vaccinated (including rabies). She is litter box trained.,,Maple is being fostered in Lauderhill, FL. For more information contact kate@ladyluckanimalrescue.com or text 754-366-3669. You can apply at www.ladyluckanimalrescue.org under the â€œAdopt a Petâ€ Tab.",

        "description":"Oz is an 8 month old black male kitten:,Oz has grown into such a sweet and very playful kitty. He loves to romp around with the other cats and play with spring toys. Heâ€™s not into snuggling, but will come greet you to get some pets when he wants them. He does have a bit of a timid personality so he would do best in a quiet home with no small children. He would be a fantastic companion for a lonely cat. Oz lost his eye to an infection as a kitten, but he can see just fine out of his remaining eye.,If youâ€™re interested in adopting Oz, you can fill out an adoption application here:,,https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/MOAR/Cat",

We were wandering around a neighborhood in Morgantown until a kind woman rescued us. We were glad because it was February, and we were cold and glad to come indoors.,,I am a very people-oriented and social kitty.  I'm a typical active kitten who takes playing to another level. If you get out the feather wand toy or laser pointer, be ready for hours of fun, entertainment and laughs. Especially the feather wand, I'll go anywhere or do anything to catch the \"bird.\",,Because of my personality, I'll fit into any kind of home.  I am used to eating canned and dry food and hope that my forever family will continue with the same diet. My date of birth is September 10, 2020.,,15519GC,,Like what you see? Please go to www.straycatblues.org/adoption-applications to submit an adoption application for this cat.

        "description":"It's a girl!  They shouted when they realized that I am a rare orange tabby.  My name is Buttercup  and I am 8 months old. I love all other kitties and live to play and wrestle. I play with my toys, watch videos in the phone and TV of course. My mum says that I have no bad habits and could be something called an ambassador for my species. I don't know what that means, but it sounds good. I am very careful in the litter box and have not had a single accident. I take long naps up high in my cat tree and sit in sun spots to take my baths. I am really hoping that my forever home has other kitties. I like kids and big humans too. I promise to be a good girl and follow your rules. I have never scratched or bitten my mum. I try to be respectful cause she lets me sleep by her with my toys. Thank you for reading about me. I hope to meet you! Love and purrs, Buttercup Please text or call Hannah 512-466-4129 in Austin. Minimum donation of $100 applies, representing a portion of the cost of her veterinary care and food. Please consider adopting me with another cat if you do not have other animals as I need someone to play with. A reduced donation will be required if you adopt two",

        "description":"Hi I'm Freezia, a petite calico kitten.  I was rescued with some other family members, Fabio and Fynn (also available for adoption).  We were wandering around a neighborhood in Morgantown until a kind woman rescued us. We were glad because it was February and we were cold and glad to come indoors.,,I am a very friendly and social kitten.  I'm a typical active kitten who loves to play. If you get out the feather wand toy or laser pointer, be ready for hours of fun. I'll go anywhere or do anything to catch the \"bird\" or chase the red dot. Sometimes I do have to stand back when my 2 boy relatives get too playful and romp over me.,,I adjusted to my foster home immediately and think I'll do the same when I find my forever home.   I am used to eating canned and dry food and hope that my forever family will continue with the same diet. My date of birth is October 10, 2020.,,Even though I am healthy now I did have a bout with calicivirus immediately after I was rescued.  So as a precaution, it's best I go into a home without other cats.,,15520GC,,Like what you see? Please go to www.straycatblues.org/adoption-applications to submit an adoption application for this cat. Once you submit the application, one of our Adoption Reps will contact you and work with you through the adoption process.  They can help to arrange a meeting for you with the cat/kitten.,,All cats and kittens adopted from Stray Cat Blues have been microchipped, spayed/neutered, are litterbox trained, have received age-appropriate vaccinations, and have been tested and found negative for FeLV and FIV - unless otherwise specifically noted. When you adopt you get a copy of our internal tracking document showing all vet work completed for the cat, which you can give to your vet as a record for the cat's ongoing care.,,Adoption Fees:,$105 per kitten for kittens under 6 months old ($210 for a pair),$95 per cat 6 months of age and up,,Thank You for considering adopting this cat! If you have any questions please contact us.",

        "description":"Hi I'm Fabio and I'm a sweet black and white male kitty.  I was rescued with some other family members, Freezia and Fynn (also available for adoption).  We were wandering around a neighborhood in Morgantown until a kind woman rescued us. We were glad because it was February and we were cold and glad to come indoors.,,I am a very friendly kitty.  I'm a typical active kitten who loves to play. If you get out the feather wand toy or laser pointer, be ready for hours of fun, entertainment and laughs. I work hard to catch the \"bird\" or chase the red dot.,,When I first went into my foster home I did hide for a day but once I came out from under the bureau, I never looked back. Once I got comfortable I was a totally different kitty.  It was like a switch went on and I went from shy to outgoing.  I am used to eating canned and dry food and hope that my forever family will continue with the same diet. My date of birth is May 10, 2020.,,15521GC,,Like what you see? Please go to www.straycatblues.org/adoption-applications to submit an adoption application for this cat. Once you submit the application, one of our Adoption Reps will contact you and work with you through the adoption process.  They can help to arrange a meeting for you with the cat/kitten.,,All cats and kittens adopted from Stray Cat Blues have been microchipped, spayed/neutered, are litterbox trained, have received age-appropriate vaccinations, and have been tested and found negative for FeLV and FIV - unless otherwise specifically noted. When you adopt you get a copy of our internal tracking document showing all vet work completed for the cat, which you can give to your vet as a record for the cat's ongoing care.,,Adoption Fees:,$105 per kitten for kittens under 6 months old ($210 for a pair),$95 per cat 6 months of age and up,,Thank You for considering adopting this cat! If you have any questions please contact us.",

        "description":"You can apply for Cupcake at www.ladyluckanimalrescue.org under the â€œAdopt a Petâ€ Tab.,,Cupcake is a beautiful Domestic Shorthair female kitten born approximately on October 5, 2020. Cupcake is a little girl with a shiny black coat. A nice woman was on vacation in North Florida and stumbled upon a mom and kittens in a desolate area. She couldn't just leave them there, so she brought them back and Lady Luck Animal Rescue was more than happy to help. Cupcake does not understand why people often overlook black kitties! This sweetheart loves to be held and carried around. Cupcake is very friendly and loves people, but her best friend in the world is her mom, Maple...because of this, we would love for them to be adopted together.,,Cupcake is spayed, microchipped, FIV/FeLV tested negative, fecal tested negative, dewormed, and vaccinated (including rabies). She is litter box trained.,,Cupcake is being fostered in Lauderhill, FL. For more information contact kate@ladyluckanimalrescue.com or text 754-366-3669. You can apply at www.ladyluckanimalrescue.org under the â€œAdopt a Petâ€ Tab.",

Whenever his fosters walk into the room he lights up, lets out the cutest high-pitched meow and rushes over to receive scratches. Headbutting is his preferred way of communicating his love for his fosters as he prances around and drops to his side to receive as many pets as possible.,,His personality is very chill and mellow as he doesn't let other things bother him as much and he loves to play. He \"killed\" many of the flying toys already while he's playing with his fosters. Baloo tried catnip for the first time and it's already his favorite thing in the world as he loves rolling around in it. He is also very smart as he's able to solve his treat puzzle very quickly and really enjoys his rewards.,,Who's ready to meet this little button nose and become his future parent!,,Prior to adoption, all cats/kittens are spayed/neutered, tested for FIV/FELV, vaccinated and microchipped.

        "description":"Iâ€™d like to meet you! My name is Bubba. I arrived at a house where the owner was shooting cats. Fortunately, he is gone now, but he did shoot me in my neck and something also happened to my nose, I donâ€™t really remember. Youâ€™ll see once you meet me that my nose is as cute as a button.,,My rescuer took me to a low-cost clinic for vetting, thatâ€™s why my ear looks funny, but they did a wonderful job stitching my neck back up so I donâ€™t mind my new look at all as it gives me character.,,I just want to be held and show you my love and affectionate side. My nails will need to be clipped often as I really like to use them to knead and snuggle in your neck.,,Sometimes I think that Iâ€™m a dog as Iâ€™ll follow you around. I really donâ€™t want to trip you, I just want you to pick me up and spend time with me. Iâ€™d like to be your Bubba. Please donâ€™t judge me on my size, Iâ€™m just a big boy with lots of love to give. I hope that you will return your affection as Iâ€™m looking for that special person and maybe even a cat sibling as I donâ€™t like to be left alone. Iâ€™m ok with another male cat as I have a friend already. It took him a while to accept me, but he just couldnâ€™t resist all my head butts.,,I may need some time to adjust, although Iâ€™m worth the wait. Please keep me in the house as I donâ€™t want to have anything else happen to me, but also my rescuer has become very attached to me. My heart knows that she only wants the best for me. Itâ€™s going to be hard on her so I may try to travel my way back and itâ€™s pretty far. She tells me that this place is temporary but I donâ€™t really understand just yet until I meet you and we fall in love.,,Love,,Bubba,,Text/call 815-405-2749 for an application.",

        "description":"Ten-month old Louie is a gentle and loving buddy. He is an adorable domestic shorthair with unique brown, grey, and orange marbling on his back and tail and pure white on his tummy and paws. He enjoys being wherever you are and would love someone to cuddle and play with. He will curl up purring on your lap and likes being held. He is big and has thick, soft fur, which makes him cozy to cuddle up with. Louie is a medium energy cat. When he is not sleeping/cuddling, he likes to run around and play with balls and toys on strings. He also enjoys sitting in the windowsill watching birds and cars, but is sensitive to loud noises. He would love a quiet house where he will get lots of attention and have someone to nap next to.,,All HART kittens and cats are vet checked, combo tested, spayed or neutered, up to date on all vaccines, microchipped, and on flea and tick preventative.,,If you are interested in any of our kitties, you must complete an online cat adoption application available at www.rescueahart.org/adopt/cat-application.  The application will put you in touch with a HART volunteer.   Thanks!,",

She has a loud meow, probably because she is a little hard of hearing, which is typical given her age. She is looking for her final home where she can live out the rest of her remaining life.,,==>If you are interested in adopting this kitty, please call the adoption by appointment phone number at (916) 875-CATS (2287) between 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Tuesdays to Sunday (closed Mondays and holidays) to set up an appointment to meet this kitty. Be prepared to give the shelter representative the animal ID number, which is A468370.,,Watch her video here:,,,or here:,https://youtu.be/5lKV0LX1R10",

Flounder is the brave one but Halley will warm up and purr from pets if you move slow and get to know her.  These guys are really something else!  Looking for experienced cat people, no kids or dogs who will give them the most AMAZING and loving forever home.  Willing to relocate to a reasonable location for the right home.

        "description":"Lizzy is an absolute sweetheart of a cat who is dying to find a family to love her. When we enter the room, she's quick to come running to rub on our legs and ask to be petted. She came with her mom, Jane, who is also looking for a home, but they aren't bonded. Lizzy does well with other cats, is fine with dogs who don't invade her bubble, and adores people, though young children who are very handsy aren't her favorite. Lizzy is about 2 so she's out of her kitten stage but doesn't spend all day lounging in one spot either. She really is the whole package! Lizzy is spayed, up to date on vaccines, dewormed, flea treated, FIV/FeLV tested negative, and mirochipped. Interested adopters can schedule an appointment and/or fill out an adoption application here: https://secondchanceas.org/adoptables",

        "description":"Tempie is a medium haired spayed female gray/white tabby kitten DOB 9/10/19,,Tempie came from a not-so-good home.  There were way too many cats and the owner needed help.  This little girl is very sweet and will make a wonderful pet.  She can be a little shy at first but is not skittish.  She is good with kids, other cats and will be fine with dogs with a slow introduction.   Tempie came in with her sister Millie.  She will be fine being adopted without her and is looking forward to having a home of her own.,,She is fixed, blood tested negative for Feline Leukemia, has 1 distemper vaccines dewormed, flea preventative and micro chipped. Adoption fee is $175.,,If you'd like to meet this kitten, the first step is to fill out our on line application on our website under Adoptable Pets. You will receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours. Link is below.,,All communicate is done via e-mail. Once a home is approved a meet & greet can be set up. We will be keeping up with social distancing and wearing masks at the meet & greets.,,To ensure that the families we approve are serious adopters we will be asking for a $25 deposit to hold the cat and your appointment time for the meet & greet. . If the pet isn't a good fit for your family the deposit will be refunded. Missed or cancelled appointments will not be refunded.,,Application link:,http://alwayshopeanimalrescue.org/?page_id=396",

        "description":"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Purrisa is a sweet girl who's looking for a new home due to some medical issues of her current owners, who is no longer able to care for her & sister Chloe. She lives with 2 other cats now, and has lived with dogs and kids. She is NOT a fan of dogs as they tend to frighten her. She is cautious upon meeting new people, but once she knows you are safe and offer attention to her, she will be your best friend. She would prefer a quiet / calm home and older kids if there are kids in the home. She would LOVE to stay with her sister Chloe, as they are bonded.,,CVRR is listing this cat as a *COURTESY* to the actual owner. This cat is not currently in the care of CVRR, so CVRR makes no representations or guarantees for the animals behavior, demeanor or health assessment. All information listed has been given by the current cats owner, and should be verified by any interested potential adopter.",

        "description":"Charlie - 1.5-2 year old sweet girl, who was left behind by her previous owners. Charlie's finder built a little house in her yard and provided food daily, but due to the old age she was not able to take Charlie home. Her neighbour reached out to our rescue asking for help to at least spay her, but as soon as we met this precious girl we couldn't let her back outside. She was placed with one of our fosters immediately, where she did not want anything but love. Charlie is now fully vetted and is ready for her forever home. She is very social, good with other cats and kids and will make any family happy. If you would like to adopt our model, please complete an application online at strayshopeforliferescue.org to arrange meet and greet",

Iâ€™ve gained almost a pound here in my foster home and Iâ€™ve been thinking about maybe finding a home of my own out there.  I promise to tell you how excited I am when you get home, every day! I love neck scratches and all the attention you will give me! I like it here, but I think Iâ€™d prefer a slower paced home where my humans are home a lot. Another feline friend would be great, but not necessary. Low energy dogs would be fine as well.,,I do have Kidney disease and will require a special diet as well as weekly injections and fluids. My foster moms are happy to love me as long as I live, but Iâ€™m hoping to find a hospice home of my own.,,**This would be a hospice foster situation. We will cover medical expenses as well as stay in constant contact**",

        "description":"DOB: 6/10/20,,Degas and Cezanne are a bonded pair of kitties who love to do almost everything together. They sleep with their paws around each other, they eat together - sometimes out of the same bowl, they often walk together with their tails around each other, and of course they play together. Degas is a little shy at times but loves to sit on the sofa next to her human. She will come by and ask for pets and of course can't resist treats. She is very curious and loves to do a lot of exploring. Cezanne is extremely outgoing and will sit in almost anyone's lap. She is high energy at times and seeks attention. She will join on video conference calls and sit right in front of your computer screen to help you with your work. Both kitties can be talkative both to each other and to you. They will sleep on your bed at night to ensure they are near you. Together, Degas and Cezanne make the perfect duo for your home.,,If you are interested in learning more about these kitties or in adopting them, please click here to email their foster parent.If you are unable to send an email to the foster parent through the link included above, please contact us and let us know what kitty you're interested in. You may also fill out our adoption questionnaire to speed up the screening process. Be sure to name the cat in the CAT PREFERENCE field at the beginning of the questionnaire. If the above links aren't live, our contact form and questionnaire are available on our website at www.kittenrescue.org.For our fees and adoption policies and procedures, please click here.",

        "description":"BONDED TO MALEFICENT,,Ursula, a beautiful grey tabby, is ready to be a \"Part of Your World\". This Disney villain has found her one true love in her sister Maleficent. The two are a bonded pair born in May 2020 that are known to stir-up a little trouble, just like the Disney characters they're named after. If you don't keep your eye on them, you may find them 'Under the Sea' (okay maybe not under the sea, but they've definitely been found under their foster mom's jacuzzi!),,Ursula is not a big fan of a lot of cuddles (that's more of an Ariel thing), unless they come from other cats. So Kiss the Girl (cat), and make her a furever member of your loving family! Something unique about Ursula is she is a polydactyl!,,Interested in adopting Ursula and Maleficient (a bonded pair) or one of our other wonderful kitties? Please visit www.VivaLosGatosCatRescue.org and complete our no-obligation, online adoption application from any PC or mobile device. Viva Los Gatos is based in Cleveland, Ohio, and adopts to residents of Northeast Ohio. Adoptions to residents outside this area are considered on a case-by-case basis.,,DOB: May 2020,Foster: JA",

Meet Gaston, born in May 2020!,,Gaston can be a lover. Sometimes he will want you to hold him in your arms or will snuggle next to you, but other times, he craves being alone (isn't that a 'Tale as Old as Time'?). Gaston is a protector. He LOVES other cats, but don't mess with them or you'll hear it from him (meow!). Gaston can be mischievous and will give up that cat bed for a nap under the hot tub. He's friendly but can be spooked easily (by the giant Beast!). Be Our Guest and give Gaston the furever home he deserves!,,Interested in adopting Gaston or one of our other wonderful kitties?

Please come by and see if Iâ€™m a match for your family.,,Adoption Fee $100,This tax-deductible fee pays for the vaccinations, spay/neuter, boarding, food, and overall care of all the animals at the shelter.,,*If you're unable to adopt, please consider donating or volunteering your time to these deserving animals currently living at HHP.

He deserves a loving home and to never have to fend for himself outdoors again.  Wilcox is a big boy with a very calm and easy-going personality.  He loves when people stop to pet him and eagerly greets visitors.  He spends most of his day calmly watching all the activity around him and sharing his adorable meow with us.,,Wilcox is FIV positive and would need to be the only cat in a home, live with other FIV positive cats, or possibly live with other non-aggressive cats.,,All NAWS cats are spayed/neutered, micro-chipped and up-to-date on vaccines.

If you're interested in adopting me, fill out an application on our website www.carmaoc.org,,Hi my name is Beretta and I can't wait to meet you. You will love my soft, multicolored coat, big green eyes, and little black mustache. I was rescued from a house with ten other cats, and it was here that I gave birth to and raised my two daughters. That is all behind me now and I think I am ready to be in a home by myself with my human family. Human attention is what I crave and if you pet me and scratch my head a loud steady purr will be your reward.,,My adoption fee is $150. That includes spay/neuter, microchip, FIV/FeLV combo test, current vaccines and health check.",

        "description":"Sylvie is an adult, spayed female cat, probably born in 2015. She's bright and bouncy, outgoing and happy to meet people. She loves to sit on shelves near the door so she can be the first to say \"Howdy\" to new people. She will turn herself upside down and inside out for attention - a total clown. She doesn't mind the other cats in her colony, but she's far more interested in humans. We haven't seen her play with toys much, but she sure likes to play with our hands and she's always up for lap time and cuddle sessions. Sylvie was adopted but struggled with the other cat, so we think she might be happiest as an only kitty. She would like to find a home with some kind children to keep her entertained.",

He came from a not so great situation with a few other kitties. He is good with other kitties but will probably take some time to adjust to a kitty friendly dog.Ryder loves to get pet and get attention as well get out and play. Sometimes he can get over stimulated which causes him to nip. This is easily correct and his foster is happy to discuss with you.Ryder is ready to go.... we are estimated him at approx 9 months to a year old. He is looking for his forever, are you it?",
