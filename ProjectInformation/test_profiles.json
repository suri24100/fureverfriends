Dream is a wonderful guinea pig, looking for a home to call his own. Dream is still getting used to being picked up and handled, but with lots of patience and socialization, he will be a wonderful piggy! Dream will need a large enclosure and plenty of time outside of the cage, which will be great for bonding and growing closer with him! Dream loves to eat Timothy hay (and should be provided an unlimited amount), pellets, and fresh greens every day. He will also need his Vitamin C supplemented, as guinea pigs do not produce their own - bell peppers are a good source! We recommend doing plenty of research before making him part of your family!

Monitor their intake of sweet/fatty foods so they can stay fit, healthy and happy. They'd love to get out of the enclosure to get a good stretch! Just be sure to put up all the cords and other chewable items, as well as blocking off any potential hiding spots that you can't reach.

At SDHS:This pet has been receiving excellent care and is now ready for their new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Bubbles! He is a wonderful guinea pig looking for a home to call his own. Bubbles enjoys snacks, his comfy house, and play time with his favorite humans! Guinea pigs are incredibly social animals who need to be kept in pairs to thrive. Bubbles came in alone, so if you have a single, male Guinea Pig at home, they might make the perfect pair! Bubbles has lived with another Guinea Pig in the past and done well. If Bubbles is in our care when another single male comes in, we might try to see if we can make him a friend and send them home together! Guinea pigs need a lot of ground space to run around and stay healthy. Two guinea pigs will need a minimum of 10 sq feet of space (more is better!) to call home. An easy and inexpensive way to give your pigs a DIY piggy palace is called a C&C fleece lined cage (google it!). Guinea pigs need lots of daily timothy hay to munch on, extra space to run around in, and toys to keep them active and enriched! Healthy greens and veggies are also an essential part of their diet, as well as a daily dose of vitamin C in the form of a supplement or a slice of orange! Bubbles has done well with children in his previous home, is friendly, and tolerates handling. He really is quite the catch! If you'd like to learn more, book an appointment today!

He's very affectionate and loving and will be a wonderful baby for someone who is experienced with guinea pigs. He's neutered so he could be housed with a accepting female.

    "description": "Hi! My name is Dax! I am a super cool bunny with the best personality! I love to be petted and held. I have participated in the Rescue Readers program here at the shelter and I am quite popular. The kiddos love me, and I love them! I would make a great companion for any person. Another awesome thing about me: I love to play fetch! If you throw me a ball, I will bat at it and throw it around. I am also a big boy. I love to eat, and it shows. You could think of me as a small dog. My previous home surrendered me to the shelter because they got a new dog who didn't know how to act around me. The staff isn't sure how I am with other animals yet. Rabbits can live over ten years, require space and commitment, and can be costly. They are social animals who want your attention and who each have their own personalities. Rabbits are fragile and have delicate spines, so their owner must be educated on proper rabbit handling. Because of this, rabbits do best with adults and older children. Rabbits need a large cage with a hide shelter, water bottle and food bowl, toys like balls and chew sticks, and a hay rack. They can be litter box trained, which means they also need a litter box. A healthy rabbit's diet consists of 80% hay with timothy, grass, and oat hays for older rabbits and alfalfa hay for young rabbits. Rabbits also need a large variety of vegetables and greens, a limited amount of rabbit food pellets, and the very occasional sugary treat like carrots or berries. Rabbits get bored just like the rest of us, and enjoy ripping up newspaper and playing with carboard boxes and toilet paper rolls. Rabbits can be messy and enjoy rearranging their cages exactly how they like it! They need room to roam and exercise outside of their cage each day, but it is very important to rabbit-proof your home areas before letting the rabbit out. They love to chew on wires and destroy paperwork, and should always be supervised. Adoption Fee: $30.00 Our bunnies are for indoors only. Adoption includes their neuter and microchip."

He has been neutered and is working on litter box training.,Rabbits are great pets, but they have very specific care needs that must be taken care of for them to live happy and healthy lives! Make sure you are committed to meeting these requirements if you are thinking of adopting from us!,,- They must have a large, clean cage with solid floors and either shredded paper bedding or fleece covering them (wood bedding can cause respiratory illness). They can also be house trained with some patience! Rabbits are very active and smart, so they require lots of space to explore and run around in! In addition to a large area, you will have to give them lots of rabbit-safe toys to play with to keep them occupied and content. Contact us to get a list of appropriate enrichment ideas and cage recommendations!,,- They must have a good quality pellet, with no dried fruit, nuts, seeds, colored bits or processed sugary treats. Ingredients like these pose a choking hazard and can also cause illness due to an imbalanced diet. We like to feed our rabbits Oxbow brand rabbit food because it is free from all of the above! Spending a bit more money for good food will save in vet bills later!,,- They require vet care. While they don't need vaccinations, they can become ill or have injuries. They need care just like a dog or cat! We can point you in the direction of an exotics vet if you don't have one already!,,- They are fragile animals, therefore children must be supervised while handling them. - We do not adopt out small animals to homes with unfixed animals of the opposite gender. If you feel you are an exception to this, please talk with staff about your situation!"

She does not swear or say anything naughty but she will screech for attention or if she is worried. She will nip you if she is worried about something and you donâ€™t appear to be getting away from the danger. For example, if the cat jumps up to look at her and she is on your shoulder she will get nervous and has been known to bite.,Kelly is looking for someone who will be patient with her and win her over. Gain her trust and treat her like the princess she is. She will only be adopted to someone with exotic bird experience. We will be checking references and doing a home visit. She will come with her cage and all of her accessories. Her only health concern was several years ago she laid multiple eggs in a row and was quite ill from the stress of that on her body. She did recover and has not laid any eggs since.,Only complete applications will be considered. Kellyâ€™s home will be selected according to the best fit for Kelly.

We would love to stay together since we've known each other all our lives, but if you have other female guinea pigs already, we are willing to go separately if we have to.

I've participated in doggy playgroup here at the shelter with other small dogs and did well with them. Don't tell the other dogs but I'm a staff and volunteer favorite around here! Everybody comments on what a great and sweet dog I am. I've spent a bit of time here because I was having some medical problems that the Vet needed to figure out for me. It turns out I have urinary incontinence and I'm doing better on medicine! My future family will need to follow up on this with their Vet to continue my medication. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $95.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included."

    "description": "Luna is okay being left alone in her crate 3-4 hours ( have not left alone more than that simply because we have been home) and she sleeps straight through the night in her crate without crying or whining. A 20 minute power walk/jog tires her out good and she will curl up in her bed and sleep. She is not yappy at all, she rarely barks or whines. She loves getting attention and belly rubs but is okay being left alone to naps after play sessions. I am a child free home so I am unsure how she would do around children. I would assume that based on how she reacts to strangers she would do well. She seems to be scared of older men with deep voices. I introduced her to my 65 year old Hispanic father 3 times and while the 3rd time she came in for a treat she seems startled by his voice. She was not scared of my young husband. Luna was originally sacred of going up our open stairs but I know happy to do so but she will not come down at all. She cries when she wants to be brought down. When neither my husband and I pay her any attention she will get sad and whine for a minute or 2 (very Briefly) and then go play with her sqeaky toy. She eats and uses the restroom normally. She has been pooping on a training pad inside and when she is taken outside she goes in grass and also in dirt."

Born around January 2018, she is beautiful, loving, joyful Pyrenees mix.,,Harper's life started out a little rocky. She was found as a hungry puppy, wandering the streets. Soon after being found, she became seriously ill and was rushed to an emergency veterinarian who found that Harper had eaten a latex glove! The glove was removed during surgery, and Harper made a full recovery.,,Fast forward to the present, as Harper was living happy life in a memory care center during the COVID pandemic. The facility underwent construction due to damage from \"snow-mageddon,\" residents were moved amongst facilities, and the chaos became too much for our sweet Harper. She needs a steady, predictable environment.,,Harper is a sensitive soul and her feelings are easily hurt with a reprimand. She is incredibly loving and cuddly. If you are okay with her fur and the space she takes up in a bed, she would love to sleep with you. If you'd rather not have her on the furniture, she will happily sleep on a fluffy dog bed nearby.,,She makes a silly grumble growly sound when she's excited and greeting people she likes. It can sound intimidating at first, but she is just saying, \"Hi! Love me!\",,Harper has been exposed to children of all ages. She loves older children who can run and play and scratch her belly. She can be over-protective of babies.,,Harper has lived in households with multiple cats and dogs. She occasionally chases the cats, but is for the most part respectful of their space. She is respectful and usually submissive to the dogs as well. She can sometimes be possessive of food. She would be fine as an only dog or with other doggie companions.,,She loves soft plush squeaky toys - the noisier the better! She also enjoys a good game of tug of war.,,Harper has a good foundation in training. She knows all the basic commands and enjoys \"shaking hands.\" She walks well on a leash after the initial excitement wears off. She crates well and will often seek out her crate if she is feeling insecure.,,SPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention.

We do not usually adopt outside of the state of FL. If interested in finding out more about one of our dogs, please fill out an application at www.4luckydogs.org, and you will be contacted by phone if you are a fit.,,Fancy's ideal forever home would be with someone who is able to be home most of the time & give her the attention she deserves. She loves to be with her people & attaches to them quickly. She seems to have lived her life being the only pet, although she is dog friendly. We recommend she either stay an only pet or possibly with one other small dog. Fancy is not a fan of cats. She is vocal when she gets excited. We have been working with her to bark less, so continuing that training is a good idea. She will follow you around the house & likes to sleep with you too. Her favorite thing to do is go for walks as often as possible. She does pull on the leash when walking, so it is important that someone can handle her pulling until she gets better with that. She only weighs 13 pounds, so it shouldn't be too hard for most people to do. She would do fine in an apartment or a home with a yard. Older children 8 years & up would be recommended since Fancy does not like her feet touched. She is very sensitive with them. This issue also makes grooming her legs & feet difficult. Fancy is a girl who wakes up in the morning happy & ready to start the day with giving you kisses. She is approximately 5 years old.,The adoption fee for this dog is $400.00 and he/she will come microchipped, neutered/spayed and up to date on all necessary shots and vaccines.

Since being in my current house, Iâ€™ve decided I love playing with all my foster brothers and sisters so I need another dog friend in my new home to play with and help teach me the ropes! My favorite things are playing extra rough with all my dog siblings and running around in the yard so I need one of those in my next home too! Iâ€™m definitely all puppy so I have a lot of energy and will need lots of toys to chew on and play with. My foster mom and dad keep me in a crate at night for sleeping and I sleep through the whole night with no accidents. Iâ€™m still working on potty training during the day but have been doing really well as long as you keep me on a good schedule. My foster parents do say Iâ€™m super sweet though and deserve the best forever home!,,If you would like to meet Denver send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.,,Adoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter surgery, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam"

She is super cute and fun, but a lot of work. Her forever family should be committed to lots of training - obedience, housetraining, and socialization. This will ensure that Rosa Diaz grows into a confident, well behaved adult! Puppies' personalities are dependent on their environment, and the structure and training they are given, in addition to socialization. Their personalities continue to grow and be shaped by their new adoptive families. Puppy daycare and socialization classes or puppy kindergarten are highly recommended for their personal development. She will more than reward you for all your hard work with lots of love, loyalty, and laughs.,,All dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.,,Welcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet!,,For more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.,,Thank you for considering adopting a dog in need!,,Woof,,,The Motley Zoo Crew"

Lola has pretty apricot/red color with white accents on her face and feet..  These starving babies were left at a abandoned house in MS.  We knocked on the neighbors door to see about them, they said neighbors moved off in middle of the night.  We loaded all of them!  Lola is a great girl.. Super sweet and super calm... SNUGGLE BUG-loves to snuggle with everything!! She loves a calm house, and will want to be on the couch with you watching tv or snuggled up in her dog bed with another dog. She is what we call a easy dog.. not demanding.. just so sweet and she is also good with cats.  We are looking for a retired couple that is home a lot and will spoil her. She deserves it!!! She is a \"kind\" soul and just wants love... We would LOVE if her new adopter had another dog to hang around with.  Lola was a great moma to her pups and she knew the second we were their to help rescue her and her babies, she was beyond grateful.. SHE IS PRECIOUS!!!!! We are looking for owner occupants, someone that is retired or home a good bit that does not mind a dog jumping on the couch or being around them all the time.. This is a special girl!!!! A true SOUTHERN JEWEL!!! We promised her that she would NEVER be abandoned again EVER! Lola has been completely vetted to include spayed, shots, bordetella, rabies, wormed, heartworm TREATED for heartworms with a SPLIT safe treatment and now she is ready to go to her forever home. Her adoption fee is $595.00 and this already includes the transport fee.  We are a 501c3 and her adoption fee is a tax deduction for you.  We thank you in advance for saving a life!  Every adoption allows us to rescue another innocent life that would perish in a pound. If you are interested in adopting Lola contact Shelly at :    lovedogs.rescue@gmail.com"

    "description": "Whenever a sweet and engaging scruffy coated dog finds themselves in an urgent situation, Farfelâ€™s is more than happy to help them find the home that they deserve. Sweet Nicole found herself stuck in a small high kill shelter in rural New Mexico. Now Nicole is headed to Colorado to find her forever home!,,Nicole is about 5 or 6 years old. She is a very sweet, friendly little girl. The vets believe her to be a Yorkie/Carin Terrier mix. Nicole weighs only 9 lbs - the perfect size to accompany her people anywhere!,,While Nicole is a very engaging girl, always expect an adjustment period when introducing a dog to a new home setting. With any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster or to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for Nicole. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine.,,Farfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area.,,Nicole is up to date on her vaccines, but not yet spayed. Spay must be done within 1 month of adoption, no exceptions! Farfelâ€™s rescue will cover all costs of Nicoleâ€™s spay!,,Nicole is arriving on transport in Boulder on 3/24/2021. Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/ and submit.,,**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue."

I can run, jump, and play just like any other cat. I just require a soft surface to land on. After a day of play, my friends here at the SPCA know how much I love cuddling, so sometimes they keep me in a special sling so I can assist with their work and give some valuable insight. Lastly, I have been titled \"Great Kitten Dad\" and have been entrusted multiple times to care for kittens who need some extra feline socialization.
